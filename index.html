<h2>About Me</h2>

<img src="./assets/images/IMG_3714.JPEG"> 

<p>My name is Nicholas Kidder, I am 24 years old. I have lived in Orange County, California my entire life. Currently, I work in a fabrication shop as welder but I discovered web/software development about a year ago and decided that that was the career I desired. I recently started going back to school as a computer science major and my goal is to transfer from the junior college that I am curently at to UCI to recive my degree. Some of my hobbies include, going to the gym, hiking, cooking, spending time with my family, my girlfriend, and my friends, and of course always trying to further my education and knowledge of new skills. One major aspect that attracted me to web development and the tech field in general is the fact that it's always growing and evolving so there will always be new skills and tools to learn.</p>
